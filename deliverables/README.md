**Description**:

- This project has implemented an AI for playing the Othello (Reversi) board game in Haskell.
- The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a custom heuristic that accounts for piece count, piece position, and piece stability.
- The project was graded on code quality, report quality, and AI performance in a tournament competing with other students.
- The project belongs to the first programming course throughout the university study.
